What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    The main problem we were trying to solve throughout this course was designing a program for ABCU's advisors to help manage courses and courese information. The program needed to load data from a file, store it in an appropriate data structure, and output its information. One of the problems that came from this was choosing which data structure to use for the program, specifically identifying which data structure meets effiecient needs for the type of data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    To approach the problem, I utilized pseudocode solutions for the different types of data structures. Different data structures work in different manners so it is important to get an understandning of how the compiler will process the data. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    One of the roadblocks I hit while working this course was that the data structures were all capable of handling the data at what would be considered normal speeds. Because of this, understanding the capabilities of every data structure was what ulitimately led me to choose a different data structure. For example in project one, we looked at the different data structs and concluded that a BST would be the most efficient.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    I have had a lot of experience with data structures and algorithms in the past, and I currently work as a programmer for my career, but this course defenitely hgelped refresh me on things that I dont utilize day to day. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    Before writing any code I usually always have a habbit of writing pseudocode and using a flow diagram (ex: lucidchart). Using these practices and being able to present them helps me understand my programs better and help others (or potentially people who take over a specific project).
